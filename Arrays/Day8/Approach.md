### Approach

- Initialize Variables.
- Iterate Over Prices and for each price If the price is less than minPrice, update minPrice with price else calculate profit by doing price - minPrice.
- Update maxProfit if this profit is greater than the current maxProfit.
- Finally return maxProfit.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n),
- Space Complexity: O(1).
