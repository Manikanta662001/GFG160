// Stock Buy and Sell – Max one Transaction Allowed

// Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days.
// The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days
// when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible
// to make a profit then return 0.

// Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

// Examples:

// Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9.
// Hence, the profit is 8.
