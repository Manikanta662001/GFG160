### Approach

- Initialize Two Variables.
  - maxSoFar to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
  - maxEnding to keep track of the current subarray sum.
- Iterate Over the Array.
- Update maxSoFar and maxEnding.
- return maxSoFar.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n),
- Space Complexity: O(1).
