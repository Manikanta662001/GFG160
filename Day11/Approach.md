### Approach

- Initialize Three Variables.
- Iterate Through the Array from index 1:
- For each element If the current element is negative, swap maxEnding and minEnding.
- Update maxEnding and minEnding.
- Update and return maxProduct. 

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n),
- Space Complexity: O(1).
