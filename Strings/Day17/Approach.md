# Day17

### Approach

- We use a fixed-size array of 26 (for lowercase 'a' to 'z') to store how many times each character appears.
- Count frequency of each character.
- Return the first character with frequency 1.
- If none found: Return '$'.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n),
- Space Complexity: O(1).
