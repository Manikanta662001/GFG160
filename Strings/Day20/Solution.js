// Strings Rotations of Each Other

// You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of 
// the string s1.

// Note: The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

// Examples :

// Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
// Output: true
// Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.
